You are the love of my life
You are the best thing that has ever happened to me
You make me smile every day
I want to hold you for the rest of time
We have shared so many happy moments together
Goo berries are the best berries
Boo hearts Goo
I will never forget our time together
Word cannot express my love for you
I hope I can always make you smile
I haven't stopped smilling since the moment we fell in love
I hope we have a thousand more memories
Words cannot express how much I love you
You make me truly happy
I wish we could be together every second
Goo + Boo = Besties
You make my heart stop when you walk in the room
I never want to stop holding your hand
Boo loves Goo
You are my lover
I want you with me always
Your smile lights up the room
Your laugh is infectious
I want you in my arms right now
XOXOXXOOXOX from Boo
A million hugs for Goo
My heart beats faster when you walk in the room
You are my everything
You are my son shine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray
I'm so lonely, ohhhh so lonely, I have nobody. TO CALL MY OWN
I'd walk a thousand miles to be with you
I want to hold your hand
Will you be my lover?
My heart beats for you
I can't get you off my mind
I can't stop thinking about you
These are the best years of our lives, and I want to spend them all with you
I couldn't ask for a better girlfriend
